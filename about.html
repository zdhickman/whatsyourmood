			We don't pull your data for our own analysis. We don't have settings for mood goals, or any way to add other objectives onto the extension's page. So, what's the point of this extension?

			The results of What's Your Mood? are entirely for you, the user, to interpret. I created this extension as a very casual way to keep track of how I'm generally feeling day-to-day. Volatility of emotions could cause me to suddenly switch my daily input from a frown to a smile; this is entirely welcome, and something that I keep in mind when viewing my graph of past emotions.

			It's up to you to decide what you want out of logging your mood. Maybe this is just for your curiosity. Or, maybe, you want to use the resulting graph for some introspective analysis. It's entirely up to you.
